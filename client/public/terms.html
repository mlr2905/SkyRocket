        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: October 21, 2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to Skyrocket! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Skyrocket website and its related services (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
        
        <p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> This is a generic, non-binding placeholder document. For a real application, you must consult with a legal professional to draft terms that are specific and legally enforceable for your jurisdiction and business model.</p>

        <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>Skyrocket provides an online platform that enables users to search for, compare, and book flight tickets and related travel services provided by third-party suppliers (e.g., airlines, aggregators).</p>

        <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
        <p>To access certain features of the Service, you must register for an account. When you register, you agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide accurate, current, and complete information as prompted by our registration form.</li>
            <li>Maintain and promptly update your information to keep it accurate, current, and complete.</li>
            <li>Maintain the security and confidentiality of your password.</li>
            <li>Accept all risks of unauthorized access to your account.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Use of the Service</h2>
        <p>You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to use the Service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In any way that violates any applicable federal, state, local, or international law or regulation.</li>
            <li>To engage in any conduct that is fraudulent, harmful, or that restricts or inhibits anyone's use or enjoyment of the Service.</li>
            <li>To perform any automated data collection (scraping, data mining) without our express prior written permission.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Bookings and Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Skyrocket is not an airline or travel agent. We provide a platform to facilitate your bookings with third-party airlines and suppliers. When you book a flight, you are entering into a contract directly with that airline or supplier.</p>
        <p>All bookings are subject to the terms and conditions, and privacy policies of the third-party supplier. We are not responsible for the services provided by these suppliers, nor for any issues arising from your booking, including but not limited to, cancellations, delays, or pricing errors.</p>

        <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The Service and its entire contents, features, and functionality (including but not limited to all information, software, text, displays, images, video, and audio, and the design, selection, and arrangement thereof) are owned by Skyrocket, its licensors, or other providers of such material and are protected by international copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.</p>

        <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Skyrocket makes no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, as to the operation of the Service or the information, content, or materials included therein. We do not warrant that the Service, its servers, or e-mails sent from Skyrocket are free of viruses or other harmful components.</p>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Skyrocket shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of any changes by posting the new Terms on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>
